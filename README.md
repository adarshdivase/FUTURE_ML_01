# Retail Sales Analysis and Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data and potentially visualizing key insights through a web application. It aims to provide an understanding of sales trends, customer behavior, or product performance based on the provided dataset.

## Project Files

* `app.py`: This is likely the main application file, possibly a Flask or Streamlit application, designed to serve a dashboard or interactive visualization of the retail sales data.
* `retail_sales_dataset.csv`: This CSV file contains the core dataset for the project, presumably including details about sales transactions, products, customers, and dates.
* `requirements.txt`: This file lists the Python libraries and their specific versions that are necessary to run `app.py` and any other scripts within this project. It ensures a consistent development and deployment environment.
* `package.txt`: This file's purpose is not immediately clear from its name alone. It might contain additional package lists, build instructions, or deployment-specific configurations. Further inspection would be needed to determine its exact role.

## Getting Started

To set up and run this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-project-directory>
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    * **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *If `package.txt` also lists dependencies, you might need to install those as well, depending on its content.*

### Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the main application:

```bash
python app.py
